This project uses github actions to compile and package itself for windows user.
All the maintainer has to do at moment of release is create a tag named under
the semantic version system (see https://semver.org).

To do so, use this command:

   git tag -s <version>

It will open your configured text editor for you to write the release notes.

The release notes must follow the following template. First line must start with the version number. Followed with an empty line, then the notes.

```
<version>

Write notes here
```
